# Knight: C# Edition
This is a [Knight](https://github.com/knight-lang/knight-lang) implementation in C#. More details about Knight, its license, and specifications can be found in the [knight-lang](https://github.com/knight-lang/knight-lang) repo.


## Compiling
I used the following command to build the C# executable (so I could test and time it):
```sh
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained -r osx.10.12-x64
```
